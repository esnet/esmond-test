We may have a LOT of files open at any given time and during the transition
between chunks we may have 2 * $LOTS open.  Set your system resources
appropriately.  On FreeBSD this is done by tuning sys.maxfiles using sysctl.
May also need to tune kern.maxfilesperproc once me move from the process per
polling group per device model.
