<p><cite>espolld</cite> is the process which polls the devices, correlates the data (if
necessary) and puts the data into a work queue which is consumed by
<cite>espersistd</cite>.</p>
<div class="section" id="operation">
<h3>Operation<a class="headerlink" href="#operation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When <cite>espolld</cite> is started it will query the database for a list of currently
active devices and which OIDSets should be polled for each device.  <cite>espolld</cite>
has two threads of execution: a thread to perform the polling and a thread to
hand data off to <cite>espersistd</cite>.</p>
<p><cite>espersistd</cite> manages writing the collected data to disk.  Data collected by
<cite>espolld</cite> is placed into a work queue in <cite>memcached</cite>.  A worker <cite>espersistd</cite>
process removes data from the <cite>memcached</cite> work queue, performs the necessary
calculations on the data and writes it to persistent storage.  The persistent
storage is either a Cassandra database or a SQL database.</p>
<p>At present <cite>espolld</cite> and <cite>espersistd</cite> do not use <cite>esdbd</cite> for database
interactions but instead contacts the SQL and Cassandra databases directly.
This issue will be addressed in future versions of esmond.</p>

<dt><cite>espersistd</cite> is the process which consumes data from the work queue that is</dt>
<dd>populated by <cite>espolld</cite>.  There is a manager process and a number of worker
processes.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="section" id="id1">
<h3>Operation<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When <cite>espersistd</cite> is started, the manager spawns a number of worker processes -
the number and type of which are defined in the [persist_queue] section of
the configuration file.  The bulk of the incoming snmp data is being handled
by the CassandraPollPersister class/worker processes so the bulk of this
discussion will focus on that.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="data-flow">
<h3>Data Flow<a class="headerlink" href="#data-flow" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As the datum is pulled off of the work queue, it is distributed to the worker
processes in a non-random way.  Data coming from a particular device is handed
to the same worker process.  This is necessary for some of the calculations
that is done to the data.  The entry point for the persister class that the
worker proces is running is the store() method.  The incoming datum is first
inserted into the raw_data table/column family.</p>
<p>If the data for that particular oid (measurment) is to be aggregated (the
bulk of the snmp data is), it is then passed to a method to caluculate a
base rate.  A base rate is a &#8220;bin&#8221; of a certain time frequency (generally
30 seconds) that can be the sum of more than one incoming raw data measurment.
The incoming raw data is a monotonically increasing counter coming from the
network devices.</p>
<p>Since the incoming values are these monotonic values, the first thing that
is done is calculating a delta.  This is done by comparing the incoming value
to the previously seen value from the same device/interface.  This is
accomplished by maintaining an in-memory collection of metadata (essentially
a python dictionary) and why the data from a given device is always
distributed to the same worker process.  This way a worker can maintain its
own internal state of device data.  If the internal metadata collection does
not contain a value for a particular device/interface (due to a restart of
the persister, etc), it will do a lookup on the raw data table/column family
for the last value seen and the metadata for that device is initialized from
there.</p>
<p>The delta is calculated and then is potentally fractionally split between
two bins of the relevant frequency.  For example, if 30 second rate bins are
being generated (one on the minute and one 30 seconds after the minute), a
measurement coming in 10 seconds after the minute will be fractionally
distributed between the two appropriate bins (see lines 510 to 518 of
persist.py for an example of how this done).</p>
<p>Another thing that is determined when calculating the delta is the time since
the last value for that device/interface was seen.  Ideally there will be a
contiguous stream of data, but if not, one of two things will additionally
occur.  If there is a particularly long gap between the current value and
the previously seen one, then the persister will backtrack and fill the gap
of bins with data that is marked as not valid.  This is how the client can
differentiate between a &#8220;valid measurement of zero bytes&#8221; and a zero that
is a corollary to a NULL value in a traditional relational database.
Alternately, if the gap is larger than &#8220;ideal&#8221; but not so large as to
indicate a gap of no measurements (perhaps the device was offline), then
additional fractional values are calculated distributed over this smaller
gap.</p>
<p>After a valid delta is calculated and the base rates are calculated and
stored on disc, then additional &#8220;higher level&#8221; aggregations are calculated
and stored.  The frequencies of these aggregations are associated with
a particular oidset&#8217;s metadata - generally hourly and daily.  These higher
level aggs are the minimum/maximum values seen during a particular time
range, and also the values necessary to calculate the average over that
hour/day/etc.  These higher level values are added to the backend, and
then the worker process accepts the next datum for processing.</p>

<div class="section" id="cassandra">
<h2><cite>cassandra</cite><a class="headerlink" href="#cassandra" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Apache Cassandra is a row-oriented datastore that has some things in
common with a key-value store.  Data are stored with a unique row key
pointing at a wide &#8216;row&#8217; of &#8216;columns&#8217; of data.  This was chosen because
it is well suited for handling timeseries data - both the data model works
well with that kind of data, and the read/write performance is suitable
as well.  Data in a given row are written to contiguous disc locations,
data ordering is handled internally by cassandra and the schema that
is defined for a given column family (the cassandra corollary to a table
in a traditional RDBMS) so it does not need to be sorted when it is read
from the backend, and due to the nature of the row key/data model, data
is not so much queried (where the engine needs to find the data) as it
is merely retrieved based on the row key and time range.</p>
<div class="section" id="row-keys">
<h3>Row Keys<a class="headerlink" href="#row-keys" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The core of storing and retrieving data from cassandra is the unique key
that points at a row of data.  One does not &#8216;query&#8217; the row keys, rather
it is something that can be constructed by the client querying the data.</p>
<p>The row keys for the stored snmp data is of the following form:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>snmp:router_a:FastPollHC:ifHCInOctets:xe-0_2_0:30000:2012
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The components of the row key are:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>ns:device_name:oidset:oid:interface_name:data_frequency:year
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The namespace component is a prefix to differentiate different kinds of
data that might later be put into the backend - currently just &#8216;snmp.&#8217;
The device name and interface names are self explanitory, the oidset is a
grouping of a particular type of mesurement (like data traffic), the oid is
the measurement itself (the direction of the data traffic), and the
frequency is the is frequency of the measurements/bins of the measurement
in milliseconds.</p>
<p>The year is an artifical construct of how the data are stored.  Rows are
divided up into a year&#8217;s worth of data to keep a given row from growing
arbitrarily wide.  A row of a year&#8217;s worth of 30 second data is somewhere
around 1.3 million columns long which is a nice healthy width for a row
inside a cassandra store.  Cassandra rows should be wide to properly use
the technology, but partitioning them by year makes for an nice easy cap
on row width.  A querying client does not need to know the year
segment of the row key because the query code in the cassandra.py module
will automatically determine this from the time range specified for the
query.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="column-families">
<h3>Column Families<a class="headerlink" href="#column-families" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A column family is the cassandra corollary to a table in a RDBMS.  It is
a collection of rows/columns defined by a &#8216;strongly typed&#8217; schema, and the
unique row keys that point to the rows.  They come in two varieties: a
regular column family and a &#8216;supercolumn.&#8217;  A regular column family is
basically a row of key/value pairs.  A supercolumn is a row of keys that
point to mulitple values (like a C struct for example) - one key, multiple
values.  This will become more clear in the following examples on how the
esmond cassandra keyspace is designed.</p>
<p>As noted before, the schema of a column family is what could be called
strongly typed.  Row keys, row column headers, the associated value (or
in the case of a supercolumn, associated values) are all defined in the
schema of being of a given type like UTF-8 strings, LONG numbers, counters
and etc.  Even though the structure of a supercolumn might look like a
form of associative array, they contain a fixed and not arbitrary mix of
data types.  There is also an internal sort order that is defined on a row
as well so that the data are returned in a certain pre-defined order.</p>
<p>This is a perennially referenced (and appropriately titled) article
describing the nature of columns and more importanly supercolumns:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://jayant7k.blogspot.com/2010/07/cassandra-data-model-wtf-is-supercolumn.html">http://jayant7k.blogspot.com/2010/07/cassandra-data-model-wtf-is-supercolumn.html</a></p>
<p>Following are discussions of the structure of the column families the esmond
data are stored in.  It has been said that this JSON-like representation of
a column family structure isn&#8217;t technically optimal, however, I don&#8217;t think
that someone has come up with a better way.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="raw-data-cf">
<h3>Raw Data cf<a class="headerlink" href="#raw-data-cf" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The raw data are stored in a regular column family with the following schema:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>// regular col family
&quot;raw_data&quot; : {
    &quot;snmp:router_a:FastPollHC:ifHCInOctets:xe-0_2_0:30000:2012&quot; : {
        &quot;1343955624&quot; :   // long column name
        &quot;16150333739148&quot; // UTF-8 containing JSON for values.
    }
}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This is a regular column family - the column name is the timestamp and the
value is the numeric value that came from the devices.  We were originaly
storing the value as a numeric type, but it&#8217;s been changed to UTF-8 in case
in the future we want to start storing more arbitrary information in JSON
blobs.  The sort order on this (and all the other esmond column families) is
on the column name - all of the columns are ordered on the timestamp.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="base-rate-cf">
<h3>Base Rate cf<a class="headerlink" href="#base-rate-cf" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The base rate data are store in a supercolumn family with the following schema:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>// supercolumn
&quot;base_rates&quot; : {
    &quot;snmp:router_a:FastPollHC:ifHCInOctets:xe-0_2_0:30000:2012&quot; : {
        &quot;1343955600&quot; : {     // long column name.
            &quot;val&quot;: &quot;123&quot;,    // string key, counter type value.
            &quot;is_valid&quot; : &quot;2&quot; // zero or positive non-zero.
        }
    }
}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The base rates are stored in a supercolumn.  Column name is the timestamp,
and the values in the supercol are a string &#8216;key&#8217; and a counter type value.
Counter types, and the name implies, is an i64 numeric data type that can be
incremented and decremented.  They initialize to a zero value and inserting
a number works like a += operation in a programming language.</p>
<p>The &#8216;val&#8217; counter is the actual value of the base rate delta and is the sum
of multiple fractional values (a base rate bin may be made of more than just
one delta).  The &#8216;is_valid&#8217; element is also a counter type and all we care
about is &#8220;does it have a value of zero or greater than zero?&#8221;  That element
is incremented by 1 every time a delta is written to the bin which will
generate a greater than zero value.  When the persister code is gap-filling
a range of data where there is missing data, that element is set to zero.
That way we can differentiate between a &#8220;valid measurement val of zero&#8221; or
a &#8220;zero value that is basically a NULL.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rate-aggregation-cf">
<h3>Rate Aggregation cf<a class="headerlink" href="#rate-aggregation-cf" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The rate aggregation data are stored in a supercolumn family with the following schema:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>// supercolumn
&quot;rate_aggregations&quot; : {
    &quot;snmp:router_a:FastPollHC:ifHCInOctets:xe-0_2_0:3600000:2012&quot; : {
        &quot;1343955600&quot; : {   // long column name.
            &quot;val&quot;: &quot;1234&quot;, // string key, counter type.
            &quot;30&quot;: &quot;38&quot;     // key of the &#39;non-val&#39; column is freq of the base rate.
        }                  // the value of said is the count used in the average.
    }
}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This is one of two column families that contain the higher level
aggregations.  This one is how we generate the aggregated averages.  It
has the same basic structure as the base rate cf - timestamp column name,
string element names and a counter type for the value.  And as before,the
&#8216;val&#8217; element contains the actual aggregated delta sums.  The wrinkle is
with the other element - in this example the element name is &#8216;30&#8217; and the
value is &#8216;38.&#8217;  What&#8217;s going on there is that the &#8216;30&#8217; (ie: the element name
that is not &#8216;val&#8217;) is the frequency of the base rates that this aggregation
is made of and the &#8216;38&#8217; is the number of of deltas that are summed to make
up the &#8216;val&#8217; element.  We need the sum, the base frequency and the number of
sums to calculate the average.  To wit:</p>
<p>average = sum_value / ( sum_count * base_frequency )</p>
<p>Or in this case:</p>
<p>average = 1234 / ( 38 * 30 )</p>
<p>These calculations are masked/performed by the cassandra.py module when
the data are retrieved, so it is transparent to the client.  But it is a
point to note how the data are stored.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="stat-aggregation-cf">
<h3>Stat Aggregation cf<a class="headerlink" href="#stat-aggregation-cf" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The stat aggregation data are stored in a supercolumn family with the following schema:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>// supercolumn
&quot;stat_aggregations&quot; : {
    &quot;snmp:router_a:FastPollHC:ifHCInOctets:xe-0_2_0:86400000:2012&quot; : {
        &quot;1343955600&quot; : { // long column name.
            &quot;min&quot;: &quot;0&quot;,  // string keys, long types.
            &quot;max&quot;: &quot;484140&quot;
        }
    }
}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This is different and somewhat more straightforward.  As usual, timestamp
column name and the super column elements are just string names and
numeric values.  This just stores the min/max rates over the given period.
No calculations or other tomfoolery like in the last example.</p>
</div>
